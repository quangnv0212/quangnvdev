# Creating Your Own ERC-721 Token: A Step-by-Step Guide

**Introduction**

The Ethereum blockchain is not just about fungible tokens like ERC-20; it also supports non-fungible tokens (NFTs) through the ERC-721 standard. NFTs have gained immense popularity for representing unique digital assets, such as digital art, collectibles, and virtual real estate. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of creating your own ERC-721 token contract.

**Understanding ERC-721**

ERC-721 is a widely used standard on the Ethereum blockchain for creating and managing non-fungible tokens. Unlike ERC-20 tokens, ERC-721 tokens are unique and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis. Each token has a distinct value and properties, making it perfect for representing individual assets.

**Creating an ERC-721 Token Contract**

Let's dive into the step-by-step process of writing an ERC-721 token contract:

**1. Solidity Programming Language:**
Just like with ERC-20 tokens, ERC-721 tokens are implemented using the Solidity programming language. Ensure you're familiar with Solidity basics before proceeding.

**2. Contract Definition:**
Start by defining your contract using the `contract` keyword and specifying that it follows the ERC-721 standard.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyNFT {
    // ERC-721 Contract Implementation
}

```

**3. State Variables:**
Define the state variables needed to manage token ownership and metadata.

```solidity
mapping(uint256 => address) private _tokenOwners;
mapping(address => uint256) private _balances;
mapping(uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;
mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

string private _name;
string private _symbol;

```

**4. Constructor:**
Create a constructor to initialize your NFT's name and symbol.

```solidity
constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol) {
    _name = name;
    _symbol = symbol;
}

```

**5. ERC-721 Functions:**
Implement the required functions of the ERC-721 standard, including `balanceOf`, `ownerOf`, `approve`, `getApproved`, `setApprovalForAll`, and `isApprovedForAll`.

```solidity
function balanceOf(address owner) public view returns (uint256) {
    return _balances[owner];
}

function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (address) {
    return _tokenOwners[tokenId];
}

function approve(address to, uint256 tokenId) public {
    // Approval logic
}

function getApproved(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (address) {
    return _tokenApprovals[tokenId];
}

function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) public {
    // Approval for all logic
}

function isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator) public view returns (bool) {
    return _operatorApprovals[owner][operator];
}

```

**6. Token Minting and Transfer:**
Implement functions for minting and transferring tokens.

```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) public {
    // Minting logic
}

function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public {
    // Transfer logic
}

function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory data) public {
    // Transfer logic with data
}

```

**7. Event Emission:**
Emit events for important actions, such as transfers and approvals.

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 indexed tokenId);
event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed approved, uint256 indexed tokenId);
event ApprovalForAll(address indexed owner, address indexed operator, bool approved);

```

**8. Additional Functionality:**
Depending on your use case, you can add more functionality like metadata management, token burning, and more.

**9. Deployment:**
Deploy your contract to the Ethereum blockchain using tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.

**Conclusion**

Creating your own ERC-721 token contract empowers you to participate in the world of non-fungible tokens. By following this guide, you'll have a solid foundation for creating unique digital assets and exploring the exciting possibilities of NFTs. Remember to thoroughly test your contract before deploying it to ensure security and functionality.
