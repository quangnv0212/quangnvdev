During my time as an Event Planner at a venue dedicated to life-long friendships, I orchestrated monthly events with a record attendance of 2000 participants. I also provided guidance to grade 12 students, assisting them in preparing for the National High School Exam and university enrollment. Additionally, I organized internal events to reinforce personal connections within our organization, fostering a sense of unity and collaboration among colleagues. This role allowed me to blend my passion for creating engaging experiences with mentorship, contributing to both meaningful connections and individual growth.
