I am Steven Nguyen, a 24-year-old software developer based in Hanoi, always with a knack for staying ahead of the curve. I studied at Foreign Trade University, a prestigious institution known for its rigorous entrance exams and high standards. With a natural curiosity and a love for keeping up with the latest trends, I initially set my sights on becoming a content creator.

My passion for creating engaging content quickly paid off. I became the admin of a Facebook page that amassed over 100,000 likes, and my posts often garnered more than 20,000 reactions. I thrived in this space, enjoying the challenge of crafting content that resonated with a wide audience.

However, the year 2021 brought unexpected changes. The world was in lockdown, and like many others, I found myself with more free time than usual. I realized that the fast-paced content creation world was starting to feel repetitive, and I wanted to challenge myself in new ways. It was then that I decided to embark on a journey that would change my life: learning how to code.

What started as a way to pass the time soon turned into a full-fledged passion. The logical structure and creative problem-solving aspects of coding fascinated me. I dedicated myself to learning, and as my skills grew, so did my love for software development.

Today, I am a software developer who still carries the same drive for innovation that once fueled my content creation endeavors. I continue to update myself on the latest trends, not just in the tech world but across all the areas that interest me. My journey from content creator to coder, complemented by my formal education in IT, is a testament to my adaptability and unyielding desire to keep learning and growing.

ðŸ”¥ **Welcome and step into my world - a place where passion and the thirst for learning always lead the way.**
