I am Vu Quang, 22 years old, student of Foreign Trade University. I used to be the person in charge of multiple social media platforms with more than 100.000 likes. However, my life gradually changed due to the extended lockdown in 2021.

I was initially someone who thrived on content creation, staying ahead of social media trends, and taking responsibility in managing over 7 university pages with tens of thousands of followers. While my peers were enjoying moments with milk tea, I felt I had achieved a distinct level of success (only a joke lol ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£).

Yet, in 2021, with the prolonged lockdown, my normal life underwent a complete transformation. I embarked on a new passion: coding. Sitting still to learn new programming languages, delving into advanced technologies, I truly immersed myself in the digital world.

At the beginning, navigating through thousands of online resources for learning proved to be challenging. I felt lost, stumbled, and even contemplated giving up. But no, I persevered. Every difficulty was just a step forward in my journey.

Effort, patience, and passion gradually propelled me past the obstacles. I learned coding, crafted small applications, and each success served as a powerful motivation. Not only did I alter my perspective on myself, but I also developed a broader view of the world of technology.

Fueled by the passion for programming, I crafted a "world of my own." Each day unfolded with exploration, learning, and creativity. I take pride in overcoming challenges and ceaselessly evolving. From a content creator on social media, I transformed into a promising coder.

ðŸ”¥ **Welcome and step into my world - a place where passion and the thirst for learning always lead the way.**
