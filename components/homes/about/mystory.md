I am Vu Quang, 22 years old, student of Foreign Trade University. I used to be the person in charge of multiple social media platforms with more than 100.000 likes. However, my life gradually changed due to the extended lockdown in 2021.

I was initially someone who thrived on content creation, staying ahead of social media trends, and taking responsibility in managing more than 7 pages with thousand of followers on Facebook. While my peers were enjoying moments with sleep, milk tea, I felt I had achieved a distinct level of success (only a joke lol ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£).

Yet, in 2021, with the prolonged lockdown, my normal life underwent a complete transformation. I embarked on a new passion: coding. Sitting still to learn new programming languages, delving into advanced technologies, I truly immersed myself in the digital world.

At the beginning, navigating through thousands of online resources for learning proved to be challenging. I felt lost, stumbled, and even contemplated giving up. But no, I persevered. Every difficulty was just a step forward in my journey.

I still remember that day vividly, after six months of diligent studying, I received a message in my inbox. As someone who had just stepped into the world of freelancing, I couldn't help but feel excited seeing those words from a new client. How that message raced my heartbeat! It was them â€“ the first ones who gave me the chance to showcase myself in the industry.

Sitting in front of the computer screen, I had received my first task â€“ a project with challenging features. However, the nervousness didn't last long. I knew it was time to apply what I had learned during the past time.

Day by day, I dedicated hours to contemplate and dive into the work. Sleepless nights seemed endless. Yet, each dive into the work also meant I was gaining a clearer understanding of the task and how to accomplish it.

And then, after weeks of dedication, the first feature was completed. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the product I had created. Happiness and pride overflowed within me. But true happiness didn't stop there.

When I received the first payment from the client, I felt deserving recognition coming my way. Every hour of studying and every effort hadn't been in vain. The $300 I received wasn't just a sum of money, it was an acknowledgment of the value my work brought.

Looking back on the journey from studying to landing that first gig, I understand that nothing comes easy. But every step forward, every challenge, has aided my growth and helped shape a clearer picture of my freelancing career. I believe these achievements are just the beginning, and the future holds intriguing challenges waiting to be conquered.

Effort, patience, and passion gradually propelled me past the obstacles. I learned coding, crafted small applications, and each success served as a powerful motivation. Not only did I alter my perspective on myself, but I also developed a broader view of the world of technology.

Fueled by the passion for programming, I crafted a "world of my own." Each day unfolded with exploration, learning, and creativity. I take pride in overcoming challenges and ceaselessly evolving. From a content creator on social media, I transformed into a promising coder.
